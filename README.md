# LunacyBot

This is my custom Discord Bot for Lunacy servers, based on https://discord.js.org/ library. Its purpose is to help automate role management through emoji responses, and to also post animated emojis in chat through !chat-commands.

The files if directly copied will not work, since it's lacking the config.json file. I won't be uploading mine here, since it includes my bots password.

I'm rewriting the code from ground up, since old version had grown bloated with bad decisions early on.
